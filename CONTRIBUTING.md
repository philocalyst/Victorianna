## Interested in contributing to a font?
It's not a simple process, but if it's something you want to do here's a few things to keep in mind:

## Read The License
Every font in the catalogue has a profile page that lists which license it uses, along with a link to information about the license. Reading that information will help you understand what additions and changes you're allowed to contributeâ€”basically what you can and cannot do.

## Changes?
Keep in mind that when contributing to a font it's important to have an idea of what changes you want to make. For example, are there missing characters you can add? Or are you wanting to change the font itself?

## Download The Font and Modify It
You can download the font on the same profile page. From there you can go ahead and modify the font with the appropriate software. We suggest the following...

## Upload
After modifying the font, it's important to understand how to send those changes back to the original designer, or else change the name of the font and upload your own version. From that same profile page there should be a link to the designer's website or email address. (Let us know if this happens to be missing.).
